My project is named anishow

Its pretty much a user database where you can add animes you've watched and think others would enjoy.

The kicker is that you cant search for the animes it's all random.

You can select the animes and find more details about them on the index.ejs (/anime page)


The framework is mostly of bootstrap 

still some response issues with screen size but for the most part everything works
